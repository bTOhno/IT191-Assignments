To accomplish my goal of getting one of these jobs out of school I will take the necessary classes towards getting my bachelors of Computer Science. While doing this I will attempt to get an internship with a company like Amazon so I would be able to get my foot in the door with the company so I would be able to have an easier chance of getting into the company after school is over. I would also take the time while working with Amazon to get certifications in any areas I can to either move up in the company or to get myself ready for another job that is considered a senior level software developer. Some of these certifications would be Sun Certified Java Programmer and Sun Certified Java Developer. These would be me more credibility in the field on top of my bachelors in computer science.  Overall, my goal would be to get to being a Senior Software Developer by time I am five or so years of experience in the field. While at Illinois State University I also plan to learn other languages such as C++ and C# since I am already learning to code in Java. From the class IT 168 I will move onto the class IT 179 which will teach me the abilities to organize and develop applications. I also plan to help make myself more marketable by taking business courses that will allow me to get a minor in business. Seeing as I already have the most uncommon requirements for a computer science major to get a minor in business, those being macro and micro economics, it will be much easier for me to obtain that degree in my three remaining years at Illinois State University. In my earlier jobs and in my internship I would hope to obtain the skills to better work with a development team and be able to eventually lead a project to help polish my skills as both a leader and a programmer. If that however is not the case I will plan to work on my own projects.
